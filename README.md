# Interpolating Polynomial Machine
//   
This is designed to complete a sequence. When given 5 adjacent numbers in a sequence, the program adds its best guess for the 6th (or next) number in the sequence.
This works best with polynomial sequences. And only 4th degree polynomials and smaller.  
It also outputs the polynomial function that interpolates the sequence.

## Areas for improvement  
1. Non-polynomial guessing
1. Higher-order polynomials
1. User determined sequence length
1. Graphical confirmation of guess
1. A better programming language
